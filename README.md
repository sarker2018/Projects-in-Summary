# Summary of the Repositories and the Projects finished.

## [Generalised linear models GLM and ANOVA with R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Generalized-Linear-Models-GLM-and-ANOVA):
* In this project I tested a hypothesis called EICA hypotheses (related to plant growth competition between native and foreign plants).
* Here, I modeled count data and continuous data, and finally tested the hypothesis with ANOVA and pairwise/Groupwise comparison
* For a detailed overview and Report, please click the link provided to the original project repository
* Tools used: 
      * For data wrangling and statistical libraries in R.
      * For report compilation RMarkdown, Latex, and Pandoc

## [Data-structure-and-algorothm](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Structure-Algorithms):
* In this Repository I am updating a short theory and implentation of data structures and algorithms in python and java

## [time-series-framework-review](https://github.com/sarker2018/time-series-framework-review):
* In this repository I created a framework review of time series approaches used in machine learning (mainly in neural network areas)
* Repository covers most of the deep learning time series algorithms for both __univariate__ & __multivariate__ datasets.
* Later, I am going to upload the Box-Jenkins method (ARIMA). Vector Auto-Regression (VAR), and other common methods such as Exponential Time Smoothing ETS, and Random Walk Models.
## [Ecosystem-modeling-and-simulation](Ecosystem-modeling-and-simulation):
* In this repository I deal with netcdf4 data extracted from [www.opencolour.org](https://www.oceancolour.org/thredds/ncss/grid/CCI_ALL-v3.1-DAILY/dataset.html) website
* Task involved simulating the scenarios with algorithms from the standard literature related to primary production in ocean (German Bight), also includes euler method implementation for ODEs.
* Done in programming language R
## [Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R)
* In this repo. I created few common plots and visualizations both in R and python
* Library used; 
    * Python: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    * R : ggplot and R-base library

## [Power-BI-Project](https://github.com/sarker2018/Power-BI-Project-Beginner)
* It was my first Power BI project and it explains how a beginner can create their first PowerBi report/dashboard step by step
* One can recreate the project by following the link provided at the heading

## [Project-Management](https://github.com/sarker2018/Project-Management#project-management)
* In this repo I recored and summarised the project managements theories agile and general project management from different paid cources and standard books
* There are multiple markdown files in the link for different project management approaches
## [Hand gesture recognition: deep learning](https://github.com/sarker2018/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Deep-Learning)
* This project deals with Hand Gestures Recognistion from video clips collected from user devices
* Library used: Tensorflow, keras, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, cv2
* Techniques used are: Conv2D, Conv3D, Dropout, ImageDataGenerator, Gradient Descent.
* For a detailed overview, please click the link provied on the heading.

## [Phishing web url detection with deep learning and logistic classifier.](https://github.com/sarker2018/Phishing-Web-url-Detection-with-Deep-Learning-and-Logistic-classifier)
* In this project, I implement fake url detection using both deep learning and logistic classifier.
* Techniques used: tockenization, word stemming, word lemmatization, word-vector, 
* Library used: Tesorflow, Pandas, numpy, keras, sklearn, nltk, seaborn, Matplotlib etc.

## [SQL-Task-Solutions-Beginners](https://github.com/sarker2018/SQL-Task-Solutions-Beginners):
* This is very small task could  be encountered during entry level job application process. 
* Task descriptions and soulution can be found in the __`SQL-Task_Solution.ipynb`__ file in the repo-link.

## [R-Shiny-App](https://github.com/sarker2018/R-ShinyApp/blob/main/README.md)
* This repo provides the links of two interactive time series plot:
     * First App: Created using R-shiny with checker boxes
     * Second App: Created using plotly with option to hover the mouse over the plot and get the corresponding values.
