# Projects-in-Summary

## 1. [Generalised linear models GLM and ANOVA with R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Generalized-Linear-Models-GLM-and-ANOVA):
* In this project I tested a hypothesis called EICA hypotheses (related plant growth competition between native and foreign plants).
* Here, I modeled count data and continuous data, and finally tested the hypothesis with ANOVA and pairwise/Groupwise comparison
* For a detailed overview and Report, please click the link provided to the original project repository

## 2. [Data-structure-and-algorothm](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Structure-Algorithms):
* In this Repository I am updating a short theory and implentation of data structures and algorithms in python and java

## 3. [time-series-framework-review](https://github.com/sarker2018/time-series-framework-review):
* In this repository I created a framework review of time series approaches used in machine learning (mainly in neural network areas)
* Repository covers most of the deep learning time series algorithms for both __univariate__ & __multivariate__ datasets.
## 4. [Ecosystem-modeling-and-simulation](Ecosystem-modeling-and-simulation):
* In this repository I deal with netcdf4 data extracted from [www.opencolour.org](https://www.oceancolour.org/thredds/ncss/grid/CCI_ALL-v3.1-DAILY/dataset.html) website
* Task involved simulating the scenarios with algorithms from the standard literature related to primary production in ocean (German Bight), also includes euler method implementation for ODEs.
* Done in programming language R
## [Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R)
* In this repo. I created few common plots and visualizations both in R and python
* Library used; 
    * Python: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    * R : ggplot and R-base library
