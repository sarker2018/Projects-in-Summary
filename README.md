# Projects-in-Summary

## 1. [Generalised linear models GLM and ANOVA with R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Generalized-Linear-Models-GLM-and-ANOVA)
* In this project I tested a hypothesis called EICA hypotheses (related plant growth competition between native and foreign plants).
* Here, I modeled count data and continuous data, and finally tested the hypothesis with ANOVA and pairwise/Groupwise comparison

## 2. [Data-structure-and-algorothm](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Structure-Algorithms)
* In this Repository I am updating a short theory and implentation of data structures and algorithms in python and java
