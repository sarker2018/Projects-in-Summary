* Library used: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Scikit- learn, nltk, seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.

## [time-series-framework-review](https://github.com/sarker2018/time-series-framework-review):
* In this repository I created a framework review of time series approaches used in machine learning (mainly in neural network areas)
* Repository covers most of the deep learning time series algorithms for both __univariate__ & __multivariate__ datasets.
* Later, I am going to upload the Box-Jenkins method (ARIMA). Vector Auto-Regression (VAR), and other common methods such as Exponential Time Smoothing ETS, and Random Walk Models.
* Tools used:
     * Python, Jupyter Notebook, Keras.models, Keras.utils, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, etc.

## [Data-structure-and-algorothm](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Structure-Algorithms):
* In this Repository I am updating a short theory and implementation of data structures and algorithms in python and java.
* Tools used:
     * Python, java, c++.

# R Programming Language, Rmarkdown, Latex, Reporting, and R Shiny Web App

## [Generalised linear models GLM and ANOVA with R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Generalized-Linear-Models-GLM-and-ANOVA):
* In this project I tested a hypothesis called the EICA hypothesis (related to plant growth competition between native and foreign plants).
* Here, I modeled count data and continuous data, and finally tested the hypothesis with ANOVA and pairwise/Groupwise comparison
* For a detailed overview and Report, please click the link provided to the original project repository
* Tools used:
     * For data wrangling and statistical libraries in R.
     * For report compilation RMarkdown, Latex, and Pandoc

## [My Master Thesis Expose](https://github.com/sarker2018/My-Master-Thesis-Expose):
* This is the initial proposal or Expose of my master's thesis at the Data Science Department, University of Kiel
* This thesis deals with Time Series Forecasting (Machine Learning Approaches of Time Series Analysis).
* Tools used:
     * RMarkdown, Pandoc, latex, Python, and R.

## [Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R](https://github.com/sarker2018/Data-Visualisation-with-Python-and-R)
* In this repo. I created a few common plots and visualizations both in R and python
* Library used; 
    * Python: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    * R : ggplot and R-base library

## [Environment-modeling-and-simulation](https://github.com/sarker2018/Environment-modeling-and-simulation):
* In this repository I deal with netcdf4 data extracted from [www.opencolour.org](https://www.oceancolour.org/thredds/ncss/grid/CCI_ALL-v3.1-DAILY/dataset.html) website
* Task involved simulating the scenarios with algorithms from the standard literature related to primary production in the ocean (German Bight), which also includes Euler method implementation for ODEs.
* Done in programming language R

## [R-Shiny-App](https://github.com/sarker2018/R-ShinyApp/blob/main/README.md)
* This repo provides the links to two interactive time series plots:
     * First App: Created using R-shiny with checker boxes
     * Second App: Created using Plotly with an option to hover the mouse over the plot and get the corresponding values.

# SQL & PowerBI

## [SQL-Task-Solutions-With-sqllite3-and python](https://github.com/sarker2018/SQL-Task-Solutions-With-sqllite3-and-python):
* This is a very small task that could be encountered during entry level job application process. 
* Task descriptions and solutions can be found in the __` SQL-Task_Solution.ipynb`__ file in the repo link.

## [Power-BI-Project](https://github.com/sarker2018/Power-BI-Project-Beginner)
* It was my first Power BI project and it explains how a beginner can create their first PowerBi report/dashboard step by step
* One can recreate the project by following the link provided in the heading
